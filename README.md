# RCMDP

Repository implementing a scalable approach for Robust Constrained MDPs. 
The approach is called Adversarial Robust Constrained Policy Gradient, which implements a scalable version of Robust Constrained Policy Gradient (Russel et al.)
where scalability is due to avoiding the inner problem in favour of a perturbation scheme

Tested on python 3.8

Dependencies and installation, see "install" file


Run the algorithm on a simple maze:

``python Benchmark_SimpleMaze.py``
